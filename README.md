# Sushi Restaurant App using Flutter

Inspired by Mitch Koko on YouTube

This Flutter application is a simple yet efficient Sushi Restaurant app that allows users to explore the restaurant's menu, view details of specific food items, and manage their orders in a cart. The app is designed with a clean and user-friendly interface.

## Flow

### Getting Started
Begin your journey on the Intro Page, where the restaurant welcomes you with a glimpse of its ambiance. To dive into the menu, simply tap the "Getting Started" button.

### Explore the Menu
The Menu Page awaits, showcasing an array of sushi delights presented in elegant cards. Explore different categories, such as rolls, sashimi, and nigiri. To discover more about a particular dish, click on its card to access the Food Details page.

### Dive into Food Details
Detailed information about each dish, including ingredients, pricing, and special features, can be found on the Food Details page. Adjust the quantity to your liking and press "Add To Cart" to include it in your order.
